Its intended audience is users who are familiar with the theory and practice of these methods, and prefer to assemble their code from modular building blocks, potentially reusing calculations. If you need an introduction, a book like Boyd (2001): Chebyshev and Fourier spectral methods is a good place to start.\n\nThis package was designed primarily for solving functional equations, as usually encountered in economics when solving discrete and continuous-time problems. Key features include\n\nevaluation of univariate and multivatiate basis functions, including Smolyak combinations,\ntransformed to the relevant domains of interest, eg ab  0),\n(partial) derivatives, with correct limits at endpoints,\nallocation-free, thread safe linear combinations for the above with a given set of coefficients,\nusing static arrays extensively to avoid allocation and unroll some loops.\n\nWhile there is some functionality in this package to fit approximations to existing functions, it does not use optimized algorithms (DCT) for that, as it was optimized for mapping a set of coefficients to residuals of functional equations at gridpoints.\n\nAlso, while the package should interoperate seamlessly with most AD frameworks, only the derivative API (explained below) is guaranteed to have correct derivatives of limits near infinity.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Concepts","page":"SpectralKit","title":"Concepts","text":"In this package,\n\nA basis is a finite family of functions for approximating other functions. The dimension of a basis tells you how many functions are in there, while domain can be used to query its domain.\nA grid is vector of suggested gridpoints for evaluating the function to be approximated that has useful theoretical properties. You can contruct a collocation_matrix using this grid (or any other set of points). Grids are associated with bases at the time of their construction: a basis with the same set of functions can have different grids.\nbasis_at returns an iterator for evaluating basis functions at an arbitrary point inside their domain. This iterator is meant to be heavily optimized and non-allocating. linear_combination is a convenience wrapper for obtaining a linear combination of basis functions at a given point.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Univariate-basis-example","page":"SpectralKit","title":"Univariate basis example","text":"We construct a basis of Chebyshev polynomials on 0 4.
